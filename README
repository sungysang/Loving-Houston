Story: As a Loving Houston staff member I would like to automatically relate a school district's Account record with a 
new church's Account record based on zip code.

Acceptance Criteria:
• When a new church Account record is created with a zip code filled in, the District Account lookup field is filled in with a district with that same zip code
• If multiple districts share the same zip code, no district is filled in

Currently in the process of cleaning up the Account Trigger to follow best practices according to APEX. Received the
following recommendations from Josiah:

    // 1. Loop through all new Accountsv to collect all zip code
    //	a. filter out Accounts with unmatched conditions 
    //	b. collect all zip codes into a Set<String> zipCodesSet
    
    // 2. Run a soql to find all matched Parent Accounts with same zip codes 
    //    Read about Apex SET class
    //    List<Accoutn> parents = [select id from Account where billingpostalcode in :zipCodesSet];
    // 
    // 3. Create a map of Account with zip code as key
    // 	Map<String, Account> zipCodeToAccount = new Map<String, Account>();
    // for (Account p : parents) { zipCodeToAccount.put(p.BillingPostalCode, p); }
    // { '92101', {Account}}
    // 
    // 3. Loop through all new Accounts
    // a. find match zip code 
    // if (zipCodeToAccount.containsKey(a.BIllingPostalCode)) { 
    // 	Account parent = zipCodeToAccount.get(a.BIllingPostalCode);
    // 	a.ParentId = parent.Id;
    // 	}
